Welcome WebTech Group Mates

I use openshift cloud for our final project host because we need a live application server and somewhere that we can commit our changes easily and track others ~
Working in your local Git repository

please check the group that I have made in Telegram for accessing to the git checkout URL the source code

If you created the application from the web console, you'll need to manually clone the repository to your local system. Copy the application's source code Git URL and then run:
WARNING

Before I start other things I want to point this important note out: This is a group activity and everybody wants to learn so the most important thing is to have good communication with each other and help each other. If you have any question or you have blocked in a certain task and you have no IDEA what to do, feel free to ask your question and ask for help. We will help you :-) that will lead to your learning and boosting up the performance of the group 


=======================

Steps that you all should familiarize yourself
Use Github

I will create a github repository and add you all inside that repository as a committer, each person has to check his/her given task inside JIRA and within the deadline sprint time, accomplish the task and commit the changes into github repository
Releasing

We will commit each release of our tested web application here and live it to the world. so after we could accomplish certain amount of task inside our JIRA project management tool, we test the application and we will set it up online inside openshift
Work with your desirable IDE

I will teach you and settle you in a way that you work with any IDE you like to accomplish your task more easily
Application Server Setup

Within your IDE, each of you must have an application server and program directly and test it there. I will teach you how you can do that in Lab class
Check you Jira regularly

The development methodology we're gonna use, is SCRUM. Make sure you understand the methodology and ask me question if you don't understand
